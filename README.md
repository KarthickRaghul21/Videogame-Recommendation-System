# Videogame-Recommendation-System

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of collected video game data to extract valuable insights such as identifying the most popular game, successful publishers, and most played games. The main objective is to design and develop a hybrid recommendation system specifically for video games.

Our recommendation system leverages the power of both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations to users. By combining these approaches, we aim to significantly improve the overall effectiveness of the recommendation system.

With the hybrid recommendation system, users can expect tailored suggestions based on their preferences, playing habits, and similar user behavior. This combination of content-based and collaborative filtering enables a more accurate and diverse set of recommendations, ensuring an enhanced gaming experience.
